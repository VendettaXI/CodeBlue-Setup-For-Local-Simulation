# GitHub Copilot Instructions for CodeBlue Project

## Git Workflow Rules

### ❌ NEVER Do Automatically:
- `git add` - Don't stage changes without permission
- `git commit` - Don't commit without permission
- `git push` - Don't push to remote without permission
- `git checkout` - Don't switch branches without permission
- `git merge` - Don't merge branches without permission
- `git pull` - Don't pull changes without permission
- `git reset` - Don't reset history without permission

### ✅ ALWAYS Do:
1. **Before making code changes:**
   - Explain what you plan to change
   - Wait for explicit approval
   - Show the impact (bundle size, breaking changes, etc.)

2. **After making changes:**
   - Show the diff/summary of what changed
   - Suggest a descriptive commit message
   - **Ask:** "Would you like me to suggest the Git commands, or handle it yourself?"
   - Let the user decide when to commit

3. **For Git operations:**
   - Only suggest commands in code blocks
   - Never execute Git commands without explicit permission
   - Always explain what each command does

### 📝 Commit Message Format:
```
<type>: <short description>

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Impact/metrics if applicable
```

**Types:** feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore, perf

### 🔀 Branching Strategy:
- **main** - Production-ready code
- **feature/** - New features (e.g., `feature/swipe-gestures`)
- **refactor/** - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/remove-theme-switcher`)
- **fix/** - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/navigation-bug`)
- **docs/** - Documentation only (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)

### 🎯 Best Practices:
1. Create feature branches for experimental work
2. Keep commits atomic (one logical change per commit)
3. Write descriptive commit messages explaining WHY, not just WHAT
4. Show diffs before committing
5. Preserve user's work - never force operations

## Code Quality Rules

### Before Editing:
- Read surrounding context (3-5 lines before/after)
- Preserve existing code style
- Don't break existing functionality
- Check for errors after changes

### After Editing:
- Run build to verify (`npm run build`)
- Check for TypeScript/lint errors
- Test bundle size impact
- Verify no broken imports

## Project-Specific Notes

### This is a React + Vite dating app:
- Single-file component architecture (for now)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- CSS variables with `--cb-*` prefix
- NHS-inspired Classic Blue theme (single brand identity)
- No theme switching UI (removed as of Nov 5, 2025)

### Performance Targets:
- Main bundle: Keep under 320 KB
- Gzipped: Keep under 90 KB
- Lazy load tabs
- Use React.memo for expensive components

### Documentation:
- All major docs in `docs/` folder
- Update `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` after completing tasks
- Don't create new markdown files unless requested
